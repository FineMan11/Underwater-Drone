## üõ† Setup Instructions

### 1. **Hardware Setup**
Follow these steps to assemble your underwater drone:
1. Connect the **Arduino ATmega** to the **L298N motor driver** and **JGB37-520 motors** using jumper wires.
2. Connect the **LoRa SX1278 modules** to the **Arduino** for wireless communication.
3. Install the **ESP32-CAM** for real-time video streaming.
4. Attach the **DS18B20** temperature sensor.
5. Power the system with the **14.8V 2600mAh battery** (ensure the battery is securely housed in a waterproof casing).

### 2. **Software Setup**
1. Install the **Arduino IDE** if you haven't already (download from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)).
2. Clone the repository or download the Arduino code from the **`src/`** folder.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the appropriate sketch:
   - For controlling motors, ESP32-CAM, and LoRa communication, use the **control sketch** (e.g., `drone_control.ino`).
   - For reading temperature data, use the **temperature sensor sketch** (e.g., `temperature_monitor.ino`).
4. Configure your LoRa settings (frequency, baud rate, etc.) as required.
5. Upload the sketches to the respective boards (Arduino Uno, Nano, ESP32).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once setup is complete, power on the drone and follow these steps to operate:

1. Use the **Arduino Nano (Controller Transmitter)** and **3-axis joystick** to wirelessly control the drone's movement.
2. The **ESP32-CAM** streams live video, which can be viewed on a connected device (using an app or direct connection via the cloud).
3. The **LoRa** modules handle communication between the drone and the base station.
4. The **temperature sensor** sends real-time temperature readings to the cloud via Arduino Cloud.
